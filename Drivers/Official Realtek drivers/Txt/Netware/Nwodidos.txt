   Location of Driver:     \NWCLIENT\DOS\PNPODI.COM

   Sample Configuration Files:
   ---------------------------
      STARTNET.BAT:
         LSL
         PNPODI
         IPXODI
         NETX or VLM (VLM's for NetWare 4.X )

      NET.CFG
         LINK DRIVER PNPODI
              FRAME ETHERNET_802.3
              EtherID 0123456789AB     ---->  This keyword  is Ethernet
                                              address of a adapter, and
                                              only  required  when more
                                              than one RTL8019 adapters
                                              exist on one system

   Setup Procedures for NetWare 3.11/3.12 Client :
   -----------------------------------------------
      Before you start with the installation process, make sure that
      the  adapter is properly installed and configured. Make sure that
      your NetWare workstation operating system is properly installed.

      1. Copy  PNPODI.COM  from the Realtek Driver Diskette subdirectory
         A:\NWCLIENT to your harddisk.

      2. Create a batch file, or add to your STARTNET.BAT file the commands
         listed above under STARTNET.BAT

      3. Edit the NET.CFG file that you copied over. Edit the file per your
         requirements (see examples above).  If there are two frame types
         listed, whichever frame type is listed first, that is the one that
         the driver will load.  See above for examples.   The NET.CFG file
         should be in the same directory with LSL.COM file.


   Setup Procedures for NetWare 4.X Client with vlm:
   -----------------------------------------------
      The  installation utility  INSTALL.EXE  is  located on NetWare's
      "Workstation for DOS" disk. Run INSTALL.EXE from the Workstation
      for DOS Disk.

      The NetWare Client Install program screen will appear.  You must
      complete each of the questions.  These options are specific to your
      needs.

      1. Enter the destination directory for the NetWare Client.
         (The default directory is C:\NWCLIENT.)

      2. Gives you the option to automatically update the CONFIG.SYS
         and the AUTOEXEC.BAT files or modify them at a later time manually.

      3. Do you wish to install support for MS Windows ? (Y/N)
         (MS Windows Subdirectory: default C:\WINDOWS)

      4. Asks you to select a network  driver and  provide  configuration
         options.  It uses the  specifications  you select to  create the
         file NET.CFG.  Insert the Realtek drivers disk when prompted for
         the driver disk and specify the driver path A:\NWCLIENT\DOS

      5. Press <Enter> to install


   NOTE:
   -----
      1. Be sure to add LASTDRIVE=Z to your CONFIG.SYS file for the
         network mappings to work properly.

      2. Installing Multiple LAN Adapters:
         The keyword, EtherID, is provided for multiple LAN adapters in a
         single system by  PNPODI.COM. If EtherID unknown, you can ignore
         it in the  NET.CFG  file and directly run  PNPODI  under the DOS
         prompt,then your screen will  display  every adapter EtherID and
         select which one you need.
