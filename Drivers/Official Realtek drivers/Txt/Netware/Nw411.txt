   Server Driver for NetWare 4.11

   Introduction:
   -------------
   This document describes the procedure to install the NetWare v4.11
   server driver for REALTEK RTL8019 Plug&Play ethernet adapter.

   Location of Driver:     \NWSERVER\411\PNPSRV.LAN

   Installaton Procedure :
   ---------------------
      Before you start with the installation  process,  make sure that
      the Novell NetWare v4.11 server is properly installed.
      Similarly, your adapter should also be properly installed in your
      server.
      1. Insert the Realtek Driver Diskette into drive A and check the
         contents of subdirectory  \NWSERVER\411, It should contain the
         following file :

         PNPSRV.LANÄÄÄ  Novell NetWare V4.11 Server Driver
         PNPSRV.LDIÄÄÄ  Novell NetWare V4.11 Server Driver Installation
                        Information File

      2. At the  NetWare prompt (indicated by the Server name), run the
         INSTALL.NLM program by typing:

         server name: LOAD INSTALL <Enter>

      3. Select "Maintenance/Selective Install" and press <Enter>.

      4. Select  " LAN Driver Options (Configure/Load/...) "  and press
         <Enter>.

      5. Press the <Ins> key to specify other drivers to install.

      6. Press  <F3>  and specify the driver path (A:\NWSERVER\411)
         and press <Enter>.

      7. The PNPSRV.LAN driver should appear in your choice list for the
         'Select a  LAN  Driver' field. Choose this  driver to start the
         driver loading and  binding  procedure.  This will allow you to
         load and bind all 4 frame types supported by NetWare.

      8. Add the LOAD and BIND statements you require to the server's
         AUTOEXEC.NCF file so that the LAN driver will load automatically
         each time the server starts up.


      Installation Notes:
      -------------------
      * Installing Multiple LAN Adapters:
         The keyword "EtherID" is the ethernet address of a adapter. This
         keyword is provided for multiple LAN adapters in a single server
         by the driver PNPSRV.LAN.  So, add EtherID in LOAD commands. For
         example:

         LOAD PNPSRV EtherID=0123456789AB FRAME=Ethernet_802.2 NAME=LAN_A
         BIND IPX TO LAN_A NET=11
         LOAD PNPSRV EtherID=0123456789BC FRAME=Ethernet_802.2 NAME=LAN_B
         BIND IPX TO LAN_B NET=22
