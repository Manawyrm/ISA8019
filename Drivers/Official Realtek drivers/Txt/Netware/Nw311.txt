   Server Driver for NetWare 3.11

   Introduction:
   -------------
   This document describes the procedure to install the NetWare v3.11
   server driver for REALTEK RTL8019 Plug&Play ethernet adapter.

   Location of Driver:     \NWSERVER\311\PNPSRV.LAN


   Installation Procedure:
   -----------------------
      Before you start with the installation  process,  make sure that
      the Novell NetWare 386 v3.11 server is properly installed.
      Similarly, your adapter should also be properly installed in your
      workstation.

      1. If you can log into the server as a supervisor , copy PNPSRV.LAN
         relative files from the Realtek Driver Diskette subdirectory
         A:\NWSERVER\311 into the NetWare 386 subdirectory SYSTEM of your
         server. (If some files exists, rename the existing files in the
         SYSTEM subdirectory).

      2. Run  SERVER.EXE  from  your  server.  You will see a series of
         NetWare messages on screen.

      3. When the NetWare 386 prompt appears (indicated by a colon),load
         your server driver. Simply type:

         : LOAD LSLENH <Enter>
         : LOAD PNPSRV <Enter>

         or, you can directly load file from Realtek RTL8019 driver disk :

         : LOAD A:\NWSERVER\311\LSLENH <Enter>
         : LOAD A:\NWSERVER\311\PNPSRV <Enter>

      4. Bind IPX to the adapter driver. At the NetWare server prompt
         ,type:

         :BIND IPX TO PNPSRV <Enter>

      5. After pressing <Enter> the computer prompts you for the Network
         Number. For details on how to assign this number,please consult
         your NetWare 386  Installation Manual.

      6. Add the load and bind statements you require to the server's
         AUTOEXEC.NCF file so that the LAN driver will load automatically
         each time the server starts up.


   NOTES:
   ------
      1. Installing Multiple LAN Adapters:
         The keyword "EtherID" is the ethernet address of a adapter. This
         keyword is provided for multiple LAN adapters in a single server
         by the driver PNPSRV.LAN.  So, add EtherID in LOAD commands. For
         example:

         LOAD PNPSRV EtherID=012345678901 FRAME=Ethernet_802.2 NAME=LAN_A
         BIND IPX TO LAN_A NET=222
         LOAD PNPSRV EtherID=012345678902 FRAME=Ethernet_802.2 NAME=LAN_B
         BIND IPX TO LAN_B NET=333

      2. Installing One LAN Adapter with Multiple Frame Types:
         When  binding multiple frame types to one adapter, enter a LOAD
         and BIND statement for each frame type. Each LOAD statement will
         use a different network number is required on the bind statement.
         You need  to supply  a name on each load line in order to avoid
         being  prompted  for which  board to bind IPX to. If you do not
         have the name option in the AUTOEXEC.NCF , it will not  execute
         completely without user intervention.  Example:

           LOAD PNPSRV FRAME=ETHERNET_802.3 NAME=LAN8023
           BIND IPX TO LAN8023 NET=77777
           LOAD PNPSRV FRAME=ETHERNET_802.2 NAME=LAN8022
           BIND IPX TO LAN8022 NET=88888


   If problems occur during the binding process, your  screen will prompt
   you with error  messages.  Please refer to your NetWare 386 manual for
   details on these messages.
