   Server Driver for NetWare 4.1

   Introduction:
   -------------
   This document describes the procedure to install the NetWare v4.1
   server driver for REALTEK RTL8019 Plug&Play ethernet adapter.

   Location of Driver:     \NWSERVER\41\PNPSRV.LAN


   Installation Procedure:
   -----------------------
      Before you start with the installation  process,  make sure that
      the Novell NetWare v4.10 server is properly installed.
      Similarly, your adapter should also be properly installed in your
      server.

      1. These files can be obtained from Realtek driver disk subdirectory
         A:\NWSERVER\41

         NBI.NLM
         MSM.NLM
         ETHERTSM.NLM

      2. If you can log into the server as a supervisor , copy PNPSRV.LAN
         relative files from the Realtek Driver Diskette subdirectory
         A:\NWSERVER\41 into the NetWare 386 subdirectory SYSTEM of your
         server. (If some files exists, rename the existing files in the
         SYSTEM subdirectory).

      3. When the NetWare server prompt appears (indicated by a colon),load
         your server driver. Simply type:

         : LOAD NBI <Entet>
         : LOAD PNPSRV <Enter>

         or, you can directly load file from Realtek RTL8019 driver disk :

         : LOAD A:\NWSERVER\41\NBI <Enter>
         : LOAD A:\NWSERVER\41\PNPSRV <Enter>

      4. Bind IPX to the adapter driver. At the NetWare server prompt
         ,type:

         :BIND IPX TO PNPSRV <Enter>

      5. After pressing <Enter> the computer prompts you for the Network
         Number. For details on how to assign this number,please consult
         your NetWare Server Installation Manual.

      6. Add the load and bind statements you require to the server's
         AUTOEXEC.NCF file so that the LAN driver will load automatically
         each time the server starts up.


   NOTES:
   ------
      1. Installing Multiple LAN Adapters:
         The keyword "EtherID" is the ethernet address of a adapter. This
         keyword is provided for multiple LAN adapters in a single server
         by the driver PNPSRV.LAN.  So, add EtherID in LOAD commands. For
         example:

         LOAD PNPSRV EtherID=0123456789AB FRAME=Ethernet_802.2 NAME=LAN_A
         BIND IPX TO LAN_A NET=11
         LOAD PNPSRV EtherID=0123456789BC FRAME=Ethernet_802.2 NAME=LAN_B
         BIND IPX TO LAN_B NET=22

      2. Installing One LAN adapter with Multiple Frame Types:
         When  binding multiple frame types to one adapter, enter a LOAD
         and BIND statement for each frame type. Each LOAD statement will
         use a different network number is required on the bind statement.
         You need  to supply  a name on each load line in order to avoid
         being  prompted  for which  board to bind IPX to. If you do not
         have the name option in the AUTOEXEC.NCF , it will not  execute
         completely without user intervention.  Example:

           LOAD PNPSRV FRAME=ETHERNET_802.3 NAME=IEE8023
           BIND IPX TO IEE8023 NET=11111
           LOAD PNPSRV FRAME=ETHERNET_802.2 NAME=IEE8022
           BIND IPX TO LAN8022 NET=22222

   If problems occur during the binding process, your  screen will prompt
   you with error  messages.  Please refer to your NetWare 386 manual for
   details on these messages.
