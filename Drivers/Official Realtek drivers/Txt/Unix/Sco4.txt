   SCO UNIX

   Introduction:
   -------------
      This document describes the procedure to install the SCO UNIX driver
      for REALTEK RTL8019 Plug&Play ethernet adapter.

   Location of Driver:     \SCO\4.X\DRIVER.O
   ------------------

   The following files will be used in this installation:
   ------------------------------------------------------

      driver.o    :  RTL PnPSCO Driver Program
      setup       :  Transfer dos format to unix format setup program
      info        :  Used by netconfig
      init        :  Used by netconfig
      master      :  Used by netconfig
      node        :  Used by netconfig
      reconf      :  Used by netconfig
      remove      :  Used by netconfig
      space.c     :  Used by netconfig
      system      :  Used by netconfig


   Installing driver procedure on SCO UNIX :
   ----------------------------------------
      Before you start with the installation  process,  make sure that the
      SCO UNIX system is properly installed. Similarly,your adapter should
      also be properly installed in your machine.

      1. Login as root user. (On maintenance mode)

      2. If you own installation Diskette in DOS format :
         Put RTL SCO UNIX Driver diskette to floppy A: and use doscp
         command to copy the file "setup" for installing RTL SCO UNIX
         PnP Driver into UNIX's directories as following :

         # cd /
         # doscp A:setup /setup

         !! if you don't have the directory ,namely, "a:/sco/4.x/." in
            the disk, you should modify contents of the setup file in
            the floppy. Please check contents of the setup file.

         # chmod +x /setup
         # ./setup

      4. (a) Use netconfig utility
             Avaiable options :

             # netconfig

             The screen will display the following messages, and Select
             item (1) to Add a chain  :

             1) Add a chain
             2) Remove a chain
             3) Reconfigure an element in a chain
             4) Quit

      5. After the above option completed, the screen display next option
         messages :

         Select item (4) : sco_tcp   SCO TCP/IP for UNIX

      6. When the user completed  the  above option, then various adapter
         drivers in SCO UNIX occur and select " RTL  PnP  Family Ethernet
         Driver board 0" item.

      7. Add chain sco_tcp -> pnp0 (y/n),   TYPE 'y'

      8. Enter the internet Address of this interface ,
         for example : 192.9.9.1

      9. Enter the netmask for this interface (default 255.255.255.0).

      10. Does the interface use a broadcast address of all 1's (y/n),
          default : y

      11. Enter the boardcast address for this interface,
          default : xxx.xx.x.255             press ENTER

      12. Are these values correct ? (y/n)   TYPE 'y'

      13. Pseudo ttys are currently configured, do you want to:

             1) Add Pseudo ttys
             2) Remove Pseudo ttys
             Select an option or enter q to quit [q]   TYPE 'q'

      14. Available options:

             1) Add a chain
             2) Remove a chain
             3) Reconfigure a element in a chain
             q. Quit

          Select option: q

      15. Do you want to relink to kernel now ?               y

      16. Do you want this kernel to boot by default (y/n)    y

      17. Do you want the kernel environment rebuilt (y/n)    y
