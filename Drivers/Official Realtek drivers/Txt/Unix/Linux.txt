The procedure to activate rtl8019 on linux :
Hint:RTL8019 is ne2000 compatable.

  step 1: make sure that kernel source code is included
  		(check /usr/src/linux)

  step 2: recompile kernel:
                cd to /usr/src/linux, them type 'make menuconfig'

                select the following options(mark them as '*')
                 .enable module support
                 .networking support
                 .TCP/IP networking
                 .network device support
                 .ethernet
                 .ne2000/ne1000 support
  step 3: after options are selected, exit and run
                make dep;make clean;make zImage;
          if no serious error happens, the new kernel 'zImage' will be in
             /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/zImage.
          copy this file to root.
          modify '/etc/lilo.conf' file to point to this new file.
          run 'lilo'
          reboot


  step 4: when system boots, the driver will be load. then the driver will
          scan {0x300,0x280,0x320,0x340,0x360} port to see if a card is 
          there.
            (you can run 'dmesg' to see the boot message)
          ps: in some case, PNPISA may assign ioports not in the range. you
              can use 'rset8019' (in DOS) to set the card in jumpless mode
              and set ioaddr to one of these ioport.

  step 5: run netconfig to setup TCP/IP
        (run 'ifconfig' or 'netstat -i' to see if there is a interface 
        'ne0')
