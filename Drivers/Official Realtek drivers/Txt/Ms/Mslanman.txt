   LAN Manager Workstation/Server

   Introduction:
   -------------
   This document describes the procedure to setup LAN  Manager 2.1
   Workstation/Server driver for REALTEK RTL8019 Plug&Play ethernet
   adapter.

   Location of Driver:(DOS) \MSLANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\ETHERNET\RTL8019\PNPND.DOS
                      (OS/2)\MSLANMAN.OS2\DRIVERS\ETHERNET\RTL8019\PNPND.OS2


   Sample Configuration Files:
   ---------------------------
      CONFIG.SYS (for DOS will contain):

          DEVICE=C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTMAN\PROTMAN.DOS /I:C:\LANMAN.DOS
          DEVICE=C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\ETHERNET\RTL8019\PNPND.DOS


      CONFIG.SYS (for OS/2 will contain):

          DEVICE=C:\LANMAN.OS2\DRIVERS\PROTMAN\PROTMAN.OS2 /I:C:\LANMAN.OS2
          DEVICE=C:\LANMAN.OS2\DRIVERS\ETHERNET\RTL8019\PNPND.OS2


      PROTOCOL.INI (will contain):

         [RTL8019_NIF]
         ; RTL8019 RPOTOCOL.INI SAMPLE

           DriverName = PNPND$
           AdapterID  = @0123456789A  ;  This item is only required when
                                      ;  more than one RTL8019 adapters
                                      ;  exist on one system.

   Setup Procedures:
   -----------------
      Before you start with the installation process, make sure that the
      adapter  is properly  installed and  configured.  Make  sure  your
      Microsoft LAN Manager is properly installed.

      1. Run the appropriate Microsoft Lan Manager SETUP for computer you
         are setting up.(DOS, OS/2 or OS/2 Server). Select "Configuration"
         item ,(the Realtek driver isn't included on the Lan Manager disk)
         and insert the Realtek driver disk, select the Realtek driver and
         follow the directions.

      2. When completed, reboot your computer .


   NOTES:
   ------

      1. Parameters for the PROTOCOL.INI file:

         DRIVERNAME: This is the one required parameter. See example at top
                     of this document for syntax.

         AdapterID : This  keyword is provided  by PNPND, and is  required
                     when  more  than  one  RTL8019  adapters exist on one
                     system. You must modify the AdapterID value in file,
                     \LANMAN\PROTOCOL.INI, by yourself.

      2. Sample PROTOCOL.INI for LAN Manager:

           [PROTMAN]
           DRIVERNAME = PROTMAN$
           DYNAMIC = YES
           PRIORITY = NETBEUI

           [NETBEUI_XIF]
           Drivername = netbeui$
           SESSIONS = 6
           NCBS = 12
           BINDINGS = "RTL8019_NIF"
           LANABASE = 0

           [RTL8019_NIF]
           ;
           ; RTL8019 PROTOCOL.INI Sample Adapter
           ;
           DriverName = PNPND$
           AdapterID  = @0123456789a
