   Packet Driver

   Introduction:
   -------------
   This document describes the procedure to setup the Packet driver for
   REALTEK RTL8019 Plug&Play ethernet card.

   Location of Driver:     \PACKET\PNPPD.COM
   ------------------

   Sample Configuration Files:
   ---------------------------
      AUTOEXEC.BAT
        PNPPD 0x60
        or
        PNPPD              (Since the default software interrupt is 0x60 )

   Notes:
   ------
      1. Load the packet driver using the software interrupt and any
         optional switches if required.

         Usage: PNPPD [options] <software_int_no>

         Example: PNPPD -i 0x7e

         The only required parameter is the software interrupt. A packet
         driver needs to have a software interrupt assigned to it for other
         programs to access it. The recommended interrupt 0x7e. If you need
         any of the options listed below, place them before the software
         interrupt on the command line.

         -i - Force driver to report itself as 802.3 instead of Ethernet II.
         -d - Delayed initialization.  Used for diskless booting
         -n - NetWare conversion.  Converts 802.3 packets into 8137 packets
         -w - Windows hack, obsoleted by winpkt
         -p - Promiscuous mode disable
         -h - Help
         -u - Uninstall

      2. This is an auto sensing packet driver.  That means it will auto-
         matically scan the system until it finds the adapter I/O address
         and IRQ. The software interrupt will still need to be given in the
         command line when invoking the packet driver.(if not be given, the
         default value is 0x60)

      3. Run PNPPD.COM, the screen will appear following message:

         Found Card 0:EtherID=52:54:4C:19:01:B8,IO=300,IRQ=5 on 16-bit slot
         Driver is attached to card 0. It is configurated as:
         System: [345]86 processor, ISA bus, Two 8259s
         Packet driver software interrupt is 0x60 (96)
         Interrupt(IRQ) number 0x5 (5)
         I/O port 0x300 (768)
         My Ethernet address is 52:54:4C:19:01:B8

      4. Installing Multiple LAN Adapters:
         If there are multiple network cards on the main board. the user
         run PNPPD.COM directly, then the screen will display :

      Found Card 0: EtherID=52:54:4C:19:00:11,IO=220,IRQ=5 on 16-bit slot.
      Found Card 1: EtherID=52:54:4C:19:01:BA,IO=300,IRQ=3 on 16-bit slot.
      Please specify which card the driver attach (0-1):

         if select 0 ,then disply :

         Driver is attached to card 0. It is configurated as:
         System: [345]86 processor, ISA bus, Two 8259s
         Packet driver software interrupt is 0x60 (96)
         Interrupt(IRQ) number 0x5 (5)
         I/O port 0x220 (544)
         My Ethernet address is 52:54:4C:19:00:11
