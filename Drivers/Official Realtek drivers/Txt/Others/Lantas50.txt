        3. When complete installation,then copy RTL8019 driver"PNPLAN5.EXE"
           from REALTEK driver diskette A:\LANTAS5 to your    LANtastic
           subdirectory C:\LANTASTI.5 .

        4. Modify STARTNET.BAT file as above sample configuration files.


   Notes:
   ------
      Installing Multiple LAN Adapters:

         If there are multiple network cards on the main board. The user
         modify your startnet.bat file as following :

         PNPLAN5 VERBOSE
         AILANBIO
         PNPLAN5/MPX=D7 VERBOSE
         AILANBIO/MPX=D7/ADAPTER=1

         The first invocation of PNPLAN5.EXE and AILANBIO.EXE loads into
         the first adapter using the default MPX number (C7), and adapter
         number 0.   The  command line  switches in the second invocation
         instruct  the  NETBIOS  to  load into the second card,  (adapter
         number 1) using and DOS MPX number D7.  If problems occur,  the
         screen will prompt you with error messages. Please refer to your
