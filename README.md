# ISA8019
ISA8019 is a modern, open-source hardware design for an ISA-bus network card.
It uses an RTL8019 chipset and is NE2000-compatible, which makes it easy to use with just about any operating system or software available. 

The design is optimized for automated assembly at jlcpcb.com.

Only the RJ45 jack, jumper headers and the DIP-28 socket for the Boot ROM have to be soldered. 
Jumpers and Boot ROM are optional, the card can be used without any jumpers configured. 

Configuration can be done in 3 modes: 
- Jumper mode (JP jumper set)  
This mode allows for manual configuration of any parameters (I/O address, IRQ, BROM address & size, etc.) manually via jumpers. Refer to the back of the PCB for details. 
- EEPROM mode (also called "Jumperless", no jumpers set)  
In this mode, all parameters can be configured via the RSET8019.EXE dos utility and will be stored in the 9364 IÂ²C EEPROM.
- PNP mode (no jumpers set)  
For modern computers and operating systems like Windows 9x or Linux, this mode is ideal. Resource management will be done by the BIOS or OS.
